# Basic-Unity-Debug
In-Game Debug Commands based on Game Dev Guide's Youtube Tutorial

This was created for me to have a copy of a debug command console made using this video (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VzOEM-4A2OM) around that I can use on any Unity project. 

I'd reccomend following along to his video before just taking this code (there's really only a couple differences). Mainly because It's a good video and I don't want to take full credit for this thing.

The tutorial uses the new Unity Input System. I've cleared out any input code from this, which means you'll have to set that up yourself, as I don't know how you're dealing with your inputs in your own game. :b
